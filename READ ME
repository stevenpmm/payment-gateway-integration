Switch Off error reporting in php.ini

For clarity a flat file structure has been created.

MYSQL_PDO  required

file PayPal.log needs apache write permissions

CREATE TABLE `request-response` (
  `id` int(11) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  `request` longtext,
  `response` longtext,
  `gateway` varchar(20) DEFAULT NULL,
  `created` timestamp NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  PRIMARY KEY (`id`)
) ENGINE=MyISAM AUTO_INCREMENT=1 DEFAULT CHARSET=latin1;

Sorry, no time for unit tests !

Simply run index.php from web server root !

I am using sandbox test credentials provided by both Paypal and Braintree. 

ISSUES: PAYPAL credit card validation often fails with 400 or 500 errors. 
I have NOT used a real credit card.

How would you handle security for saving credit cards?
